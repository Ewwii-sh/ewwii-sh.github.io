After setting up ewwii, the next step is installing and setting up **eiipm**, which is ewwii's package manager.

Eiipm helps you install and manage binaries, plugins, and themes, so you can extend ewwii without manual setup.

### Quick Example

To install a theme:

```bash
eiipm install awesome_theme
```

To update all installed packages:

```bash
eiipm update
```
