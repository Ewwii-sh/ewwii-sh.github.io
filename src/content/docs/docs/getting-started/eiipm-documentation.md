## Getting Started with Eiipm

After setting up ewwii, the next step is learning **eiipm**, its package manager.  
Eiipm helps you install and manage binaries, plugins, and themes, so you can extend ewwii without manual setup.

### Quick Example

To install a theme:

```bash
eiipm install ewwii # install the ewwii binary
```

To update all installed packages:

```bash
eiipm update
```
