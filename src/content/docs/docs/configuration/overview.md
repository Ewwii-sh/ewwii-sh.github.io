Ewwii uses **[Rhai](https://rhai.rs)** as its configuration language. This gives ewwii extreme flexibility and power without sacrificing performance and easiness.

In this section, we'll cover:

- The structure of configuration files
- Embedding expressions within properties and attributes
- Accessing and using built-in variables
- Interpolation, scoping, and reactivity rules

> If you're coming from EWW's Yuck, expect similarities in structure but with much more flexibility and logical programming.
