# Ewwii - Widgets for everyone made better!

Ewwii (ElKowar's Wacky Widgets improved interface) is a foork of
Eww (ElKowar's Wacky Widgets) which is a
widget system made in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/),
which lets you create your own widgets similarly to how you can in AwesomeWM.

**Strength of Ewwii over Eww:**

-   Full-fledged scripting & expressions
-   User-defined widget trees & composition
-   Built-in configuration libraries
-   Builtin tooling for better developer experience
-   Full control over reactive updates (user defines if widget should update dynamically)

Ewwii is configured in [Rhai](https://rhai.rs/)
and themed using [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS)
or [SCSS](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sass_(style_sheet_language)>),
it is easy to customize and is powerful and dynamic.
The main goal of Ewwii is to make configuration easy
and to give the user all the power that they need.

Rhai is not just a basic markup language. It is a full embeddable scripting language!
This makes ewwii's configuration even more flexible and powerful.

Whether you're building a tiling-friendly status bar, a floating dashboard, or a themed control panel, Ewwii gives you the tools to design it, script it, and make it your own.
